## Campaign - Operation Deep Strike

Operation deep Strike is a multi-part Campaign. 

## Episode One.

Sit down, strap in and hang on for a wide ride. Who or what are these things that 'Kidnapped' Valvaren and why is she stuck in the middle of this intrigue. Who is this 'Mr Smith' and what sort of a name is 'Silent Chapter'? that keeps the company on tender hooks. These questions and more.
