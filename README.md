# ODS
**Installation**

ODS is a single BattleTech Campaign with multiple Flashpoints. Each Epidode will be released as completed and each episode builds on the previous Epidode. Save games are preserved.

**Please Note -**
ODS Episode One - Bloody Insects - is the continuation of the 'Call of the Locusts' campaign.

- Download the Github release - it will always be the latest.
- If you have a previous version of ODS, delete the directory <<directory>your game installation>/Mods/Campaign - Operation Deep Strike in total.
- Copy the folder "Campaign - Operation Deep Strike" from the release package into the /Mods directory.
- Copy the folder "ColourfulFlashpoints" in to the /Mods folder and accept the message to replace.
###**Note**###
this only replaces the settings.json file and only affects the display of ODS files. No Mod DLLs are contained herein.

The Operation Deep Strike makes several assumptions 
- Campaign assumes you have previously played the Arano Restoration Campaign as some of the conversations mention characters and events in that Campaign.
- It is strongly suggested that you have completed the Call of the Locusts campaign. There is an opportunity to review Call of the Locusts early on in this Campaign though the information is severley condensed. The Call of the Locusts mod IS a required mod and must be loaded for ODS to work.
- Your Company has an MRB rating of greater than 150.

**This is not for the faint of heart.**

## Episode One. 
### Bloody Insects.

Sit down, strap in and hang on for a wide ride. Who or what are these things that 'Kidnapped' Valvaren and why is she stuck in the middle of this intrigue. Who is this 'Mr Smith' and what sort of a name is 'Silent Chapter' that keeps the company on tender hooks. These questions and more.

### v4.0.0 release
If you played an initial release then this fixes will be of use.
1.  Fixes that prevent the flashpoint proceeding past the 3rd Mision.
2.  Adjusted balance to match the improvemts in the AI. Means you can't just stand a shoot any more.
