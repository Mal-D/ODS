There is nothing, both legal and illicit, that Indri Consortuim are not involved in or out of their reach. The Silent Chapter enforces control of their slice of the Black Market in the Periphery using a variety of roving Pirate units or Mercenary units of 'dubious' reputation, and are HIGHLY selective about who works for them.",
