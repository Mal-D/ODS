They may have all been 'returned' but were they all dismantled? Also it's pretty solid, albeit circumstantial, evidence that these 'Manei Atrocis' and 'The Master' are somehow ComStar connected.   *  u(:

We wouldn't be here except that Smith called in our 'Chit' but, losing my Darl' would be unthinkable. If that happens I'm holding you responsible - you don't want me as an enemy.

Smith, if you're still listening, there is nowhere you can hide where I won't find you if that happens.*m
