The discovery of the Helm Memory Core shook their very foundations of power but, they are still squabbling and going nowhere. This piece of Star League technology will break that impasse. When this gets out, and it will, the strategic advantage ComStar has, will be negated. I know now why Smith has you on a short leash.*d
